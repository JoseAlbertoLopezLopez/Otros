abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of Navigation Among Movable Obstacles (NAMO): a practical extension to navigation for humanoids and other dexterous mobile robots. The robot is permitted to reconfigure the environment by moving obstacles and clearing free space for a path. This paper presents a resolution complete planner for a subclass of NAMO problems. Our planner takes advantage of the navigational structure through state-space decomposition and heuristic search. The planning complexity is reduced to the difficulty of the specific navigation task, rather than the dimensionality of the multi-object domain. We demonstrate real-time results for spaces that contain large numbers of movable obstacles. We also present a practical framework for single-agent search that can be used in algorithmic reasoning about this domain.}

A number of examples are given. Two approaches aimed at addressing some of the present limitations are discussed. One is designed to produce stable, evenly distributed packing patterns; the other caters for multi-drop loads. A comprehensive performance analysis using both published and randomly generated test problems is presented. The procedure used to create the latter is described in full to enable replication. It is shown that the two methods, when combined, provide a powerful and versatile tool.}

abstract = {This paper presents a multi-population biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) for the single container loading problem (3D-CLP) where several rectangular boxes of different sizes are loaded into a single rectangular container. The approach uses a maximal-space representation to manage the free spaces in the container. The proposed algorithm hybridizes a novel placement procedure with a multi-population genetic algorithm based on random keys. The BRKGA is used to evolve the order in which the box types are loaded into the container and the corresponding type of layer used in the placement procedure. A heuristic is used to determine the maximal space where each box is placed. A novel procedure is developed for joining free spaces in the case where full support from below is required. The approach is extensively tested on the complete set of test problem instances of Bischoff and Ratcliff [1] and Davies and Bischoff [2] and is compared with 13 other approaches. The test set consists of 1500 instances from weakly to strongly heterogeneous cargo. The computational experiments demonstrate that not only the approach performs very well in all types of instance classes but also it obtains the best overall results when compared with other approaches published in the literature.}

abstract = {As the 3D printing technology starts to revolutionize our daily life and the manufacturing industries, a critical problem is about to e-merge: how can we find an automatic way to divide a 3D model into multiple printable pieces, so as to save the space, to reduce the printing time, or to make a large model printable by small printers. In this paper, we present a systematic study on the partitioning and packing of 3D models under the multi-phase level set framework. We first construct analysis tools to evaluate the qualities of a partitioning using six metrics: stress load, surface details, interface area, packed size, printability, and assembling. Based on this analysis, we then formulate level set methods to improve the qualities of the partitioning according to the metrics. These methods are integrated into an automatic system, which repetitively and locally optimizes the partitioning. Given the optimized partitioning result, we further provide a container structure modeling algorithm to facilitate the packing process of the printed pieces. Our experiment shows that the system can generate quality partitioning of various 3D models for space saving and fast production purposes.},

abstract = {We study the problem of creating a complete model of a physical object. Although this may be possible using intensity images, we here use images which directly provide access to three dimensional information. The first problem that we need to solve is to find the transformation between the different views. Previous approaches either assume this transformation to be known (which is extremely difficult for a complete model), or compute it with feature matching (which is not accurate enough for integration). In this paper, we propose a new approach which works on range data directly and registers successive views with enough overlapping area to get an accurate transformation between views. This is performed by minimizing a functional which does not require point-to-point matches. We give the details of the registration method and modelling procedure and illustrate them on real range images of complex objects.}

abstract = {We present a practical vision-based robotic bin-picking system that performs detection and three-dimensional pose estimation of objects in an unstructured bin using a novel camera design, picks up parts from the bin, and performs error detection and pose correction while the part is in the gripper. Two main innovations enable our system to achieve real-time robust and accurate operation. First, we use a multi-flash camera that extracts robust depth edges. Second, we introduce an efficient shape-matching algorithm called fast directional chamfer matching (FDCM), which is used to reliably detect objects and estimate their poses. FDCM improves the accuracy of chamfer matching by including edge orientation. It also achieves massive improvements in matching speed using line-segment approximations of edges, a three-dimensional distance transform, and directional integral images. We empirically show that these speedups, combined with the use of bounds in the spatial and hypothesis domains, give the algorithm sublinear computational complexity. We also apply our FDCM method to other applications in the context of deformable and articulated shape matching. In addition to significantly improving upon the accuracy of previous chamfer matching methods in all of the evaluated applications, FDCM is up to two orders of magnitude faster than the previous methods.}

This paper considers the task of bin picking, where multiple objects are randomly arranged in a heap and the objective is to sequentially grasp and transport each into a packing box. We model bin picking with a discrete-time Partially Observable Markov Decision Process that specifies states of the heap, point cloud observations, and rewards. We collect synthetic demonstrations of bin picking from an algorithmic supervisor uses full state information to optimize for the most robust collision-free grasp in a forward simulator based on pybullet to model dynamic object-object interactions and robust wrench space analysis from the Dexterity Network (Dex-Net) to model quasi-static contact between the gripper and object. We learn a policy by fine-tuning a Grasp Quality CNN on Dex-Net 2.1 to classify the supervisor’s actions from a dataset of 10,000 rollouts of the supervisor in the simulator with noise injection. In 2,192 physical trials of bin picking with an ABB YuMi on a dataset of 50 novel objects, we find that the resulting policies can achieve 94\% success rate and 96\% average precision (very few false positives) on heaps of 5-10 objects and can clear heaps of 10 objects in under three minutes.

abstract = {Mobile manipulation problems involving many objects are challenging to solve due to the high dimensionality and multi-modality of their hybrid configuration spaces. Planners that perform a purely geometric search are prohibitively slow for solving these problems because they are unable to factor the configuration space. Symbolic task planners can efficiently construct plans involving many variables but cannot represent the geometric and kinematic constraints required in manipulation. We present the FFRob algorithm for solving task and motion planning problems. First, we introduce extended action specification (EAS) as a general purpose planning representation that supports arbitrary predicates as conditions. We adapt existing heuristic search ideas for solving strips planning problems, particularly delete-relaxations, to solve EAS problem instances. We then apply the EAS representation and planners to manipulation problems resulting in FFRob. FFRob iteratively discretizes task and motion planning problems using batch sampling of manipulation primitives and a multi-query roadmap structure that can be conditionalized to evaluate reachability under different placements of movable objects. This structure enables the EAS planner to efficiently compute heuristics that incorporate geometric and kinematic planning constraints to give a tight estimate of the distance to the goal. Additionally, we show FFRob is probabilistically complete and has a finite expected runtime. Finally, we empirically demonstrate FFRob’s effectiveness on complex and diverse task and motion planning tasks including rearrangement planning and navigation among movable objects.}

abstract="Rearranging objects on a planar surface arises in a variety of robotic applications, such as product packaging. Using two arms can improve efficiency but introduces new computational challenges. This paper studies the structure of dual-arm rearrangement for synchronous, monotone tabletop setups and develops an optimal mixed integer model. It then describes an efficient and scalable algorithm, which first minimizes the cost of object transfers and then of moves between objects. This is motivated by the fact that, asymptotically, object transfers dominate the cost of solutions. Moreover, a lazy strategy minimizes the number of motion planning calls and results in significant speedups. Theoretical arguments support the benefits of using two arms and indicate that synchronous execution, in which the two arms perform together either transfers or moves, introduces only a small overhead. Experiments support these points and show that the scalable method can quickly compute solutions close to the optimal for the considered setup.",

abstractnote={\&lt;p\&gt;We propose an actor-critic algorithm that uses past planning experience to improve the efficiency of solving robot task-and-motion planning (TAMP) problems. TAMP planners search for goal-achieving sequences of high-level operator instances specified by both discrete and continuous parameters. Our algorithm learns a policy for selecting the continuous parameters during search, using a small training set generated from the search trees of previously solved instances. We also introduce a novel fixed-length vector representation for world states with varying numbers of objects with different shapes, based on a set of key robot configurations. We demonstrate experimentally that our method learns more efficiently from less data than standard reinforcementlearning approaches and that using a learned policy to guide a planner results in the improvement of planning efficiency.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

abstract = {There is a deep and useful connection between statistical mechanics (the behavior of systems with many degrees of freedom in thermal equilibrium at a finite temperature) and multivariate or combinatorial optimization (finding the minimum of a given function depending on many parameters). A detailed analogy with annealing in solids provides a framework for optimization of the properties of very large and complex systems. This connection to statistical mechanics exposes new information and provides an unfamiliar perspective on traditional optimization problems and methods.}
